# Pick-To-Learn, in Python / Jax

### Installation

A virtual environment is optional, but highly recommended.

```
git clone https://github.com/danielpmorton/picktolearn
cd picktolearn
pip install -e .
```

For JAX GPU support, you'll need to run `pip install -U "jax[cuda12]"`

To run the examples, use `pip install -e ".[examples]"` to install the additional dependencies
